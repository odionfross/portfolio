										<h2>Background</h2>
									</header>
									<p>The typical workflow in the health care industry is still paper-based and it requires too much time and manual tracking for enrolling patients. meshMD offers a digital solution to improve their work efficiency, and ultimately save more patients lives by helping them get on medication they need on time.</p>

										<h2>Problem</h2>
									</header>
									<p>I designed our previous software used by three top 10 global pharmaceutical companies. However, it was based on many assumptions so it was unclear how they were using it and if it truly improved their efficiency. To figure it out, user testing and research was necessary. And then based on user research data, a redesign project needed to start to improve UX/UI. </p>

										<h2>Challenges</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Nevertheless, the 5 users from our user testing, oncology drug navigators of Ontario (ODANO), considered our product clear, intuitive and easy to learn. They successfully completed all tasks given to them, which exemplified user goals our software has been designed to accomplish. Yet, some problems and pain points were still interfering our product from being even better. It was my job to take our designs to the next level with evidence. <br><br> should be flexible and look generic so that any branding variables such as logos, colours, or background images can be easily swappable and embodied into a template effortlessly. I had to keep that in mind.</p>

									<p>A/B testing, think-aloud screen & voice recordings, questionnaire, focus group discussion, affinity diagramming.<br><br>A/B testing between our traditional form UI and a Typeform-inspired version was incorporated to study what works better - form interface is the most prominent element of our software. During the testing, I wrote down my notes, observing how they completed each task and where pain points occured. And then each designer had an one-on-one interview with the users. After the research, I sat down with the team to go over all the findings, and prioritized based on effort level (Easy vs Hard) and impact level (High vs Low). This method helped estimate how actionable each item is for implementation.</p>

									<p>Problem:  The testing results showed that ODANOs all used the New Enrolment section on the dashboard for enrolling patients instead of using the nav bar menu. I wanted to find a way to elevate the usage of the new enrolment section more as it is the most used/recommended menu for users.<br><br>Solution:  I came up with an inclusive filter modal having both filter and search. Therefore, the order of which action should be taken first does not matter anymore. Also, users only see filter options after clicking the menu, which puts more emphasis on the list, the main purpose of the list screen.</p>

										<h2>What I Learned</h2>
									</header>
									<p>Importance of user research:  It was my first professional user research, and I learned again that understanding my users such as their behaviour, personality, pain points, etc, is crucial to make more user-centred solutions and design more intuitive user-interface. There were many new findings that I did not know about before, and it was an eye-opening experience.<br><br>Thinking ahead of the future:  At first, I did not know about more menus in the future. When I checked to confirm about it, it was already after I finished a few nav bar drafts without considering possible more menus. Although before starting to design, I came up with a list of questions to understand the project better, I never realized about the future perspective of the software. As a product designer, it is also my job to tackle every design perspective of the business. I should broaden my thinking to not only present but also the future.</p>
